# Clicky-Game-React
Memory game using reactjs

## Overview

This is a memory game using Reactjs. The application's UI implements the use of components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## How it works

1. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image responds to click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page re-shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
